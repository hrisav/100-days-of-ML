# 100 Days of Machine Learning


**_Day 1_**

#### Types of ML Systems

- Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

Supervised : Training data includes labels. Eg - Classifcation (learn how to classify - emails), Regression (predict a target numeric value - price of a car)

Unsupervised : Training data is unlabeled. Eg - Clustering.

- Batch and Online Learning

Batch : system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data. It takes lot of time.

Online : train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially. Great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow.

- Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning

Instance-Based : system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases by comparing them to the learned examples, using a similarity measure.

Model-Based : build a model use that model to make predictions.

##### Main Challenges of ML

- Insufficient Quantity of Training Data
- Nonrepresentative Training Data
- Poor-Quality Data
- Irrelevant Features
- Overfitting the Training Data
- Underfitting the Training Data
- Stepping Back

##### Testing and Validating

- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection
- Data Mismatch
